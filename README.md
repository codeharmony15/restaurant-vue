# Restaurant Application

The idea behind this project is to cover some of the most important functionalities used in Vue creating a real PWA application.

![](doc/demo.gif)

## Quick Start

Firstly, clone and install all necessary packages, then start it locally.

```
> git clone https://github.com/gid-master/restaurant-vue-app.git

> npm install

> npm start
```

Initially the application will work normally because it's using mock data. However, if you want to connect to a backend API, you need to have the <strong>node.js</strong> project up running.

[Grab the NodeJs API Project right here](https://github.com/gid-master/restaurant-node-api)

Once you have the API running, you just need to change the environment variable to be able to listen to the endpoins, the variable can be found inside .env file in the root folder.

```
VUE_APP_BACKEND_TARGET=api
```

That's all, now you can also have the project listening to the backend API.

## Devices Support

As this is a demo in order to show features of a specific framework, the application is not fully ready to support multiple screens sizes, browsers and devices. However, you can check this repositoty which contains the same application developed for this responsive purpose.

Check out the list of screens that can be used to play around with this demo.

#### Mobile Support Only

- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
- Iphone X
- Pixe 2
- Pixe 2 XL
- Galax S5
- Moto G4

#### Browsers

- Chrome
- Safari

## Vue 3 Approaches

There are some of the Vue 3 concepts that were approached in this application.\
I used standard eslint and prettier settings, but feel free to switch to the one you like the most.\
Some developers can feel annoyed working with a line limit of 80 which is defined as default.

- Vue Config

  - Proxy settings (request API using same local port)
  - Global styles settings (access variables globally)
  - Environment Variables (overriding proccess env)
  - PWA to include custom service worker and manifest
  - Fully typescript

- Vuex

  - Single source of truth
  - Break logic down in modules and example using root state
  - useStore hook
  - Logic to transform data inside getters

- Axio

  - Centralize logic using services
  - Interceptor to handle responses and requests (header token and response status)
  - Jwt Authentication (cookie authentication)
  - Handling server issues and redirect to error pages
  - Axio adapter to intercept http requests and use mock data instead

- Router

  - Authentication Guards (protect authorized pages)
  - ScrollBehavior (scroll page back to the top for same route)
  - Lazy loading components
  - Catch not found routes
  - Using extra router data to hide or show specific page content

- Components

  - View components as page route only
  - Container x Presentational components (all logic in one place only)
  - Encapsulated styles using global variables to keep consistent
  - Each module in its folder using container component as start point to deal with the entire logic
  - Props and Event Emmiter in order to communicate parent with child components
  - Shared components used across the entire application
  - Different watchers using one or multiple parameter and also immediate settings
  - Slots to add dynamic content in the component

- Lifecycle Hook

  - Mounted to execute function just when the component is ready to manipulate DOM elements
  - Unmonted to kill events
  - Watcher to execute functions based on props changes

- Directives

  - Fallback images (load fallback image if path is not found)

- Utils Format (used as previous deprecated filters)

  - Format dynamic image path
  - Format currency

- Utils Storage

  - Save cart into local storage (can be recovered from offline mode)
  - Save token authentication in cookie (best practice because doesn't use session)

- Reactive form

  - Encapsulate entire logic inside the form (returns only after having a valid data)
  - Vuelidate to validate forms (standard, custom and mixed validations)
  - Native validations and also custom validations to specific field
  - Force submit form though parent component (when the submit button is in a different component)
  - Two ways data bind using v-model (example in login components)

- PWA

  - Manifest with main settings for theme, images, orientation and name
  - Install home screen shortcut (delegating logic to the application)
  - Service Workers to work with offline data (caching products API to be able to work offline)
  - Cache assets (server images and local assets)
  - Request a new version update (update only if user agree with it)
  - Great lib to generate manifest file and images automatically based on logo svg
  - Custom events to have the communication between service workers and application
  - Connection, online and offline notifications.
  - Push notification permission (this one has server interaction)

- Concepts

  - Composition API
  - Reactivity using reactive and ref variables
  - Computed to transform data and listen to store
  - Props and emitters to have components communication
  - DOM used as ref (call child component functions directly from parent)
  - Get rid of filters, now functions have the same performance as old filters

- Styles
  - Scss structure
  - Encapsulated styles
  - Global typography
  - Global colors (palette of colors used in the applciaiton)
  - Consistent paddings and margins across all components
  - Bind classes using conditions

## How to Run

This is the frontend application only, however, you can run it using either mocked data (already in place) or API server.

In order to have it runing along with a backend API, you need to follow the steps for further settings.

<br/>

Install all necessary packages.

```
npm install
```

<br/>

Initialize the application

```
npm start
```

## Using Mock

There is a folder called mocks inside the project workspace, and this folder contains files with preset data that simulates the backend responses.

<b>axios-mock-adapter</b> used to intercept http requests and return the mocked data.\
Check out the index.ts file inside the mock folder.

Open the .env file and enable or disable this option whenever you want, just change the <b>VUE_APP_BACKEND_TARGET</b> value to mock, after that all data will come from the mock folder.

Keep in mind that once you have changed back the <b>VUE_APP_BACKEND_TARGET</b> to use api, then you need to run any of our backend API's in order to get responses.

However, the best part is that you don't need to do anything, it works automatically behind the scenes.

Ps: Clear your checkout storage to avoid product ids issue if you were using API project before.

## Using API's

The idea of this project is show how simple is having the same application working across different technologies.

There are a few different options of backend to test the application using API's.

- Node JS
- .Net Core
- Go Lang
- Python

<br/>

All backend projects are already pointing to the same port, however, if you need to use a different port for some reason, you also need to change the <b>vue.config.js</b> file in order to keep the proxy settings working correctly.

Change the object <b>devServer</b> inside vue.config.js file to point to the new API address. After it all your requests still go through the localhost port 8080 using the api route.

Notice that this proxy settings works only on development mode, once you build the applciation for production all this devServer block is gone, and then you should define this settings on the server side.

<br/>

You can also have the same project using serverless.

## Structure & Flow

Short description about how the project folder structure works and how the data and components are connected.

#### Routers

Routers point just to view files (inside view folder).\
This is the place where we keep all load lazing logic and also the guards to prevent any unauthorized access.

#### Views

Views are just simple components that represent the application pages and its modules.\
Shouldn't have any logic inside this components.

#### Components

Each view imports its container components which handles the entire logic of the specific module.\
The components folder has all modules subfolders, and inside each module subfolder a structure followed by container and presentational components.\
The communication between container and presentational components should be done through props, events and store actions only.

#### Container Components

This component is responsible for dealing with the entire module logic.\
Here is the place where we dispatch events and get data from store, then we pass all information to the presentational components display on the screen.

#### Presentational Components

This component is responsible for showing data only, mostly to keep its logic encapsulated.\
Some presentational components has its own logic, such as, form validation or accordion, however, always using data loaded from container component.

#### Shared Components

This folder has all generic components used across the entire projects, such as, grid, card, wrapper and block layout. So, if you change any details in these components will affect the entire project.

#### Data Flow

The entire logic goes through the store to manage the application state.\
We simply use the dispatchers to request when some specific data should be processed.

Then inside the container components we use getters to listen to all states, and from there automatically load everything.

We dispatch 2 requests when the application is initialized, after that all dispatches are done inside the containers, and that's how the communication starts.

## Progressive Web Application (PWA)

This application fully supports PWA and we deal with all major functionalities.

The user is able to install the application and receive notification when the application is running offline.\
After the first access, the application works entirely offline, so the user can browser through the menu, visualize every single product details and also add ptoducts them to the cart. However, the checkout process can be done only after the connection is recovered.

In order to get the PWA working properly for this project, we need to customize only a few files.\

- Vue Config
- Manifest
- Service Workers
- PWA Controller
- Push notification using VAPID Key

#### Vue Config

If you don't define workbox option, vue will automatically create the service-wroker file.\
However, we need to create our own customization in order to cache a few extra data, after that PWA will listen to our customized service worker file.

#### Manifest

Manifest file is located inside public folder.\
This file is responsible for personalizing your application, predefined settings like theme, icons, name and orientation.

#### Service Workers

There are 2 different service wokers, and both of them are located inside the src folder.

- registerServiceWorker.ts\
  This file pretty much register the custom service worker mentioned below and makes available a few hooks to interact with your applicaiton.\
  In this project we are using the update and offline hooks to dispatch customized events to our application in order to have some interaction with the user.

- service-worker.js\
  This file uses pretty much the workbox and handle all logic to cache some application content.\
  In addition to caching the applicaiton we also cache server images and the main product request.\
  Then with the product request cached, we are able to have the entire application working offline normally.

#### PWA Controler

The logic to deal with PWA is totally centralized in an unique component located inside components/shared/pwa folder.

This component is responsible for listening to all events and show interactive messages to the user.\
There is no PWA logic outside of this component.

In this component we deal with online / offline messages, a modal to show that there is a new version available and also the install application modal.

#### Push Notification

There are 3 simple steps in order to get the push notification working properly.\
There is a push event implemented in the service-worker file, this event is responsible for listening to messages that are sent though server or using the chrome dev tools.

Firstly, we need to generate the VAPID private and public key using the most common lib called web-push.\
Using the backend API, you can see scrit and a simple class that deal with it already.

The public key was added as VUE_APP_VAPID in the .env file, the applications uses this public key to convert it into Uint8Array in order to request user permission to receive notifications.\
There is a function inside the PwaController implementations that handles the permission dialog using this key. An endpoint and auth are generated once the user allows the application to interact with notifications.\
Then we grab this endpoint and save it into the user collection, from now all the time we need to send user notification the backend can use it to have the communication.

Accessing any of the backend examples you can check for web-push and simulate how we send messages, however, you can test it using the webtools / application / push notification.

#### Push Notification Tests

Or you can also use this website to be able to test push notifications creating public / private key and also simulate push messages.

You can also use this website to be able to test push notifications creating public / private key and also simulate push messages.

webpush doc: https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/

Send message using this structure:

```
{
  "notification": {
    "title":"Restaurant",
    "icon":"img/icons/favicon-32x32.png",
    "vibrate":[100, 50, 100],
    "body":"testing!!!"
  }
}
```

#### Support

Keep in mind that PWA works only when you build the project and host it somewhere.\
If you serve it direclly from the project you won't be able to test the functionalities.

I strongly recommend you to run the script defined in the package.json and access it using the defined port. However, you need to install the http-server package globaly.

```
npm install http-server -g
npm run pwa
```

Or you can build the project and use the web server for chorme to host the application easilly.

After that you will be able to double check everthing using the devtools / application (manifest, service worker and cache)

#### Generate Assets

The project already contains all the images and the manifest file already in place, however, you can see how it was easily generated.

All the images can be found inside the folder public/img/icons\
These images are defined inside the manifest.json file located in the same folder level, so this file is responsible for personalizing your application, predefined settings like theme, icons, name and orientation.

<br/>

Firtly, you need to install an auxiliar package globaly.

```
npm install -g vue-pwa-asset-generator
```

<br/>

Secondly, add your SVG logo inside the root folder of the project.

After that run the command below and double check the all files will end up inside the public folder of your project.

```
vue-asset-generate -a logo.svg
```

<br />

We have added a short script inside the package file.

```
npm run pwa-generate
```

## Firebase Deployment

Firebase hosting is the easiest way to server a https application for zero cost.\
You can easily sign up Firebase using your Google account and follow the documentation to create your first project.

firebase doc: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting

Once you have created your project, just replace the project name inside the <b>.firebaserc</b> file located in the root folder.

After that you can simply use CLI commands to deploy your project.

<br />

Firstly, install the firebase tools globaly.

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

<br />

Secondly, authenticate the CLI using your user and password.

```
firebase login
```

<br />

Finally, use the script already in place to deploy your project.

```
npm run deploy
```
